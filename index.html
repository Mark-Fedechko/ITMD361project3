    <h1>About Me</h1> 
			<p>I am a 4th year student majoring in Information Technology Management. I am from the west suburbs of chicago. I love nature and exploring it through hiking or any other physical activity. Fun fact about me is that I have biked across America last summer!</p>
    <h2>Journey of Hope</h2>
			<ul>
					<li>I signed up to bike across America a year ago and have since completed the journey from June 3rd to August 9th.</li>
					<li>The journey oif hope accomplishes a great task of supporting and raising awareness for people with disabilities. This summer 621 thousand dollars were raised for people with disabilities. </li>
					<li>This journey has shown me some of the best parts of life and the hardest struggles at the same time. I am very grateful to have had to opportunity to cycle and after two months of cycling into D.C. I still imagine that day everyday.</li>
